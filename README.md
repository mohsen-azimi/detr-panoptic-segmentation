# PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION USING DETR

## Directions to try out Bounding Box Predictions
1. [Open this link which directs to the Colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15O413og2oirRTu2zIwqKYb0GeMhUo8BQ?usp=sharing) where you can try out predictions on your own images, or see the results of predictions done already.
2. Save a copy of this colab file and follow the below steps there.
    - `File` -> `Save a copy in Drive`
3. Download this [weights file and upload it in your drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_sIyMr-qzKgnBUSK4CV_2bhU0m5sBik/view?usp=sharing).

4. Modify the `weights_file_path` variable according to your use case:  
`weights_file_path` = "&nbsp;" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (if you have uploaded the file directly in base of your drive)  
`weights_file_path` = "path/to/file" &nbsp; (if you have uploaded the file in some other folder in drive)

5. Once done, go to `Runtime` -> `Run all`.
6. It will prompt to validate drive access after a while, to be able to access the specified models weights file.
7. The output of the final cell will be the predictions of the image provided.
